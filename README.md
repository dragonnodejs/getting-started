# DragonNode.js
Welcome. Here you can find the first steps you need to understand and to work with DragonNode.js.

- [Chapter1 - The structure of an application](chapter1)
- [Chapter2 - The "Hello World!" with express](chapter2)
- [Chapter3 - Use bundles for common features](chapter3)

After the chapters just start an own application with one of the skeletons, use available bundles, group own modules to own bundles and share them.
And not forget, feel free to share your feedback and experience with me.
